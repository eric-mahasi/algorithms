# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By contributing to this repository, you
agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get Started  

* First [fork][fork] the repository and then clone it using:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/algorithms.git  

* After that create a branch for your changes. For example:  
  * add_XXX if you will add new data structures or algorithms.  
  * fix_XXX if you will fix a bug on a certain data structure or algorithm.    
  * doc_XXX if you added to or edited documentation.

You may contribute by:
- implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under
right section (e.g. arrays, stacks, etc). Make a new section for it if
it doesn't fall under any section. Make sure that your implementation works.  
- optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
- adding a different solution for the problem.
- finding and fixing bugs.
- adding examples to explain the algorithms better.
- improving documentation.

## Pull Requests
Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

We will review and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* All algorithms should be written in **Python 3**.
* Write clean and understandable code.
* Properly comment the code and briefly explain what the algorithm is doing in the [docstrings][docstr].
* You may also explain the output using a minimal example.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].

## Collaborators
You can ask for any help or clarifications from the collaborators.
